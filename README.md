## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>

Globally, only 1-in-3 adults are 'financially literate'. Access to financial data and financial data insights are often presented in ways that are boring and difficult to interpret for the average user. *Your mission*, find ways to make financial data *easier to interpret, interact, understand and visualize*.

To acheive your mission, we grant you access to our brand new financial data API. The API grants you access to data that describe the financial instruments, provide historical data, and prices in streaming mode. A full text search completes the service. The API leverages REST/JSON, GraphQL and websocket technologies.

You can access our API Portal https://bfi-mvp-portal.six-group.com/portal/bfi/
Sample codes in Javascript and Python are provided.
A ZIP file contains 10 certificates to connect to the API. The ZIP file password will be provided during the presentation.

## <p align="center"> Expected Outcome: </p>

A Front-end/UI that displays content delivered by our API using modern techonologies. Ideally a working prototype is expected but a mock up is also acceptable.
